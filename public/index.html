      content="Yiseul LeMieux is a Korean-born artist living in New York City. Her work transcends disciplinary boundaries, often bringing together components in numerous media to create vivid narratives and alternative realities. 
      She collaborates frequently with her partner Masson LeMieux, as well as with other artists, and her work often has a special focus on direct audience engagement and community feedback. LeMieux's disinterest with conventional boundaries between various media, between the artist and the viewer/listener, 
      and the creative and receptive process are a part of her larger creative vision. She locates herself within a global network of entities 
      -- a world of unconventional interchangeability and a rejection of assigned values. The artist is interchangeable with another human, an animal, a vegetable, and/or a mug, et cetera. This ethos of interchangeability allows her to explore the infinite potential both of herself and of the entire world around her."
